This is Impulse-based collision simulation made using C++ and legacy OpenGL. The work is still in progress but 
I'm quiet happy with the results so far. Some functions are still being developed.

In main you can uncomment objects that you would like to see in the scene.

Use arrow keys to move controllable objects.
